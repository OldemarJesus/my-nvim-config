# NVIM CUSTOM CONFIG

This is my custom nvim configuration with lua.

Here I have integrated some:
- LSP Functionality
- Catppuccin Theme
- Treesiter and Telescope
- Much more

## Requirements

- Configure [ASDF Plugin](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)
- Configure NodeJS with asdf

**Note**
> Just to mention that I'm just starting with vim now.
